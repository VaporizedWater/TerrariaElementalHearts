A revival of the classic mod - Elemental Hearts - adds in numerous consumable life crystals crafted using the various elements found across the game, bought from NPCs, or rewarded for killing bosses. 

	Quality > Quantity!
	Great addition to any modded playthrough.
	Gives a use for leftover/extra blocks and ores, without being unbalanced.
	Spreads with progression.
	Simply complex.

Additions:
	Full localization support for all text contained within this mod.
	Fixed Journey Mode research costs of default items being set to 1.
	Config option: Crafting station required toggle, enabled by default.

Planned Additions:
	Checklist UI for showing which hearts have been used.
	Consumable that disables effects of hearts earned temporarily with either a toggle or timer.

Recently updated to 1.4.4, and currently doing a complete overhaul of the entire mod before adding the checklist UI. This will include how the mod saves data.
However, there is no need to worry about old saves, I will keep the legacy loading/saving options in and will provide a config option to turn this on/off.
For this version of the mod (1.14), there will be no config option until I finish the overhaul, and all saving and loading will function as usual.
