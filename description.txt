A revival of the classic mod - Elemental Hearts - adds in numerous consumable life crystals crafted using the various elements found across the game, bought from NPCs, or rewarded for killing bosses. 

	Quality > Quantity!
	Great addition to any modded playthrough.
	Gives a use for leftover/extra blocks and ores, without being unbalanced.
	Spreads with progression.
	Simply complex.

Note: This mod functionally changes nothing from the original.

Additions: 
	Full localization support for all text contained within this mod.
	Fixed Journey Mode research costs of default items being set to 1.
	Config option: Crafting station required toggle, enabled by default.

Planned Additions:
	Checklist UI for showing which hearts have been used.
